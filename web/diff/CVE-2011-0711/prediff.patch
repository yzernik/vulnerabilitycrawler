   xfs: prevent leaking uninitialized stack memory in FSGEOMETRY_V1
   
   The FSGEOMETRY_V1 ioctl (and its compat equivalent) calls out to
   xfs_fs_geometry() with a version number of 3.  This code path does not
   fill in the logsunit member of the passed xfs_fsop_geom_t, leading to
   the leaking of four bytes of uninitialized stack data to potentially
   unprivileged callers.
   
   v2 switches to memset() to avoid future issues if structure members
   change, on suggestion of Dave Chinner.
