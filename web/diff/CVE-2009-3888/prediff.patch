   NOMMU: Don't pass NULL pointers to fput() in do_mmap_pgoff()
   
   Don't pass NULL pointers to fput() in the error handling paths of the NOMMU
   do_mmap_pgoff() as it can't handle it.
   
   The following can be used as a test program:
   
   	int main() { static long long a[1024 * 1024 * 20] = { 0 }; return a;}
   
   Without the patch, the code oopses in atomic_long_dec_and_test() as called by
   fput() after the kernel complains that it can't allocate that big a chunk of
   memory.  With the patch, the kernel just complains about the allocation size
   and then the program segfaults during execve() as execve() can't complete the
   allocation of all the new ELF program segments.
