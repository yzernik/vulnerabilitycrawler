   xfs: prevent swapext from operating on write-only files
   
   This patch prevents user "foo" from using the SWAPEXT ioctl to swap
   a write-only file owned by user "bar" into a file owned by "foo" and
   subsequently reading it.  It does so by checking that the file
   descriptors passed to the ioctl are also opened for reading.
