   'kill sig -1' must only apply to caller's namespace
   
   Currently "kill <sig> -1" kills processes in all namespaces and breaks the
   isolation of namespaces.  Earlier attempt to fix this was discussed at:
   
   	http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/7/23/148
   
   As suggested by Oleg Nesterov in that thread, use "task_pid_vnr() > 1"
   check since task_pid_vnr() returns 0 if process is outside the caller's
   namespace.
