   personality: fix PER_CLEAR_ON_SETID
   
   We have found that the current PER_CLEAR_ON_SETID mask on Linux doesn't
   include neither ADDR_COMPAT_LAYOUT, nor MMAP_PAGE_ZERO.
   
   The current mask is READ_IMPLIES_EXEC|ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE.
   
   We believe it is important to add MMAP_PAGE_ZERO, because by using this
   personality it is possible to have the first page mapped inside a
   process running as setuid root.  This could be used in those scenarios:
   
    - Exploiting a NULL pointer dereference issue in a setuid root binary
    - Bypassing the mmap_min_addr restrictions of the Linux kernel: by
      running a setuid binary that would drop privileges before giving us
      control back (for instance by loading a user-supplied library), we
      could get the first page mapped in a process we control.  By further
      using mremap and mprotect on this mapping, we can then completely
      bypass the mmap_min_addr restrictions.
   
   Less importantly, we believe ADDR_COMPAT_LAYOUT should also be added
   since on x86 32bits it will in practice disable most of the address
   space layout randomization (only the stack will remain randomized).
