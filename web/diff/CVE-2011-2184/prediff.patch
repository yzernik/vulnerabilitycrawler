   Set cred->user_ns in key_replace_session_keyring
   
   Since this cred was not created with copy_creds(), it needs to get
   initialized.  Otherwise use of syscall(__NR_keyctl, KEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT);
   can lead to a NULL deref.  Thanks to Robert for finding this.
   
   But introduced by commit 47a150edc2a ("Cache user_ns in struct cred").
