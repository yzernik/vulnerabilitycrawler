   netfilter: ipt_CLUSTERIP: fix buffer overflow
   
   'buffer' string is copied from userspace.  It is not checked whether it is
   zero terminated.  This may lead to overflow inside of simple_strtoul().
   Changli Gao suggested to copy not more than user supplied 'size' bytes.
   
   It was introduced before the git epoch.  Files "ipt_CLUSTERIP/*" are
   root writable only by default, however, on some setups permissions might be
   relaxed to e.g. network admin user.
