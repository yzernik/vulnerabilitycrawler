   V4L/DVB: ivtvfb: prevent reading uninitialized stack memory
   
   The FBIOGET_VBLANK device ioctl allows unprivileged users to read 16
   bytes of uninitialized stack memory, because the "reserved" member of
   the fb_vblank struct declared on the stack is not altered or zeroed
   before being copied back to the user.  This patch takes care of it.
