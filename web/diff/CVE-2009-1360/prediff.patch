   ipv6: don't use tw net when accounting for recycled tw
   
   We already have a valid net in that place, but this is not just a
   cleanup - the tw pointer can be NULL there sometimes, thus causing
   an oops in NET_NS=y case.
   
   The same place in ipv4 code already works correctly using existing
   net, rather than tw's one.
   
   The bug exists since 2.6.27.
