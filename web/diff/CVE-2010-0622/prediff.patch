   futex: Handle user space corruption gracefully
   
   If the owner of a PI futex dies we fix up the pi_state and set
   pi_state->owner to NULL. When a malicious or just sloppy programmed
   user space application sets the futex value to 0 e.g. by calling
   pthread_mutex_init(), then the futex can be acquired again. A new
   waiter manages to enqueue itself on the pi_state w/o damage, but on
   unlock the kernel dereferences pi_state->owner and oopses.
   
   Prevent this by checking pi_state->owner in the unlock path. If
   pi_state->owner is not current we know that user space manipulated the
   futex value. Ignore the mess and return -EINVAL.
   
   This catches the above case and also the case where a task hijacks the
   futex by setting the tid value and then tries to unlock it.
