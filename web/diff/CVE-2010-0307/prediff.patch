   Split 'flush_old_exec' into two functions
   
   'flush_old_exec()' is the point of no return when doing an execve(), and
   it is pretty badly misnamed.  It doesn't just flush the old executable
   environment, it also starts up the new one.
   
   Which is very inconvenient for things like setting up the new
   personality, because we want the new personality to affect the starting
   of the new environment, but at the same time we do _not_ want the new
   personality to take effect if flushing the old one fails.
   
   As a result, the x86-64 '32-bit' personality is actually done using this
   insane "I'm going to change the ABI, but I haven't done it yet" bit
   (TIF_ABI_PENDING), with SET_PERSONALITY() not actually setting the
   personality, but just the "pending" bit, so that "flush_thread()" can do
   the actual personality magic.
   
   This patch in no way changes any of that insanity, but it does split the
   'flush_old_exec()' function up into a preparatory part that can fail
   (still called flush_old_exec()), and a new part that will actually set
   up the new exec environment (setup_new_exec()).  All callers are changed
   to trivially comply with the new world order.
