   x86-64: syscall-audit: fix 32/64 syscall hole
   
   On x86-64, a 32-bit process (TIF_IA32) can switch to 64-bit mode with
   ljmp, and then use the "syscall" instruction to make a 64-bit system
   call.  A 64-bit process make a 32-bit system call with int $0x80.
   
   In both these cases, audit_syscall_entry() will use the wrong system
   call number table and the wrong system call argument registers.  This
   could be used to circumvent a syscall audit configuration that filters
   based on the syscall numbers or argument details.
