   Btrfs: fix checks in BTRFS_IOC_CLONE_RANGE
   
   1.  The BTRFS_IOC_CLONE and BTRFS_IOC_CLONE_RANGE ioctls should check
   whether the donor file is append-only before writing to it.
   
   2.  The BTRFS_IOC_CLONE_RANGE ioctl appears to have an integer
   overflow that allows a user to specify an out-of-bounds range to copy
   from the source file (if off + len wraps around).  I haven't been able
   to successfully exploit this, but I'd imagine that a clever attacker
   could use this to read things he shouldn't.  Even if it's not
   exploitable, it couldn't hurt to be safe.
