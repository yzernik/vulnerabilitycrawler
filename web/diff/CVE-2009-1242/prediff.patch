   KVM: VMX: Don't allow uninhibited access to EFER on i386
   
   vmx_set_msr() does not allow i386 guests to touch EFER, but they can still
   do so through the default: label in the switch.  If they set EFER_LME, they
   can oops the host.
   
   Fix by having EFER access through the normal channel (which will check for
   EFER_LME) even on i386.
