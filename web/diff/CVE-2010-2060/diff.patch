commit 2e8e8c6387ecdf5923dfc4d7718d18eba1b0873d

    Discard job body bytes if the job is too big.
    
    Previously, a malicious user could craft a job payload and inject
    beanstalk commands without the client application knowing. (An
    extra-careful client library could check the size of the job body before
    sending the put command, but most libraries do not do this, nor should
    they have to.)
    
    Reported by Graham Barr.
