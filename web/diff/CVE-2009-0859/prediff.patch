   shm: fix shmctl(SHM_INFO) lockup with !CONFIG_SHMEM
   
   shm_get_stat() assumes that the inode is a "struct shmem_inode_info",
   which is incorrect for !CONFIG_SHMEM (see fs/ramfs/inode.c:
   ramfs_get_inode() vs.  mm/shmem.c: shmem_get_inode()).
   
   This bad assumption can cause shmctl(SHM_INFO) to lockup when
   shm_get_stat() tries to spin_lock(&info->lock).  Users of !CONFIG_SHMEM
   may encounter this lockup simply by invoking the 'ipcs' command.
