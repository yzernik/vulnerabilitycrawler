   tcp: Increase TCP_MAXSEG socket option minimum.
   
   As noted by Steve Chen, since commit
   f5fff5dc8a7a3f395b0525c02ba92c95d42b7390 ("tcp: advertise MSS
   requested by user") we can end up with a situation where
   tcp_select_initial_window() does a divide by a zero (or
   even negative) mss value.
   
   The problem is that sometimes we effectively subtract
   TCPOLEN_TSTAMP_ALIGNED and/or TCPOLEN_MD5SIG_ALIGNED from the mss.
   
   Fix this by increasing the minimum from 8 to 64.
