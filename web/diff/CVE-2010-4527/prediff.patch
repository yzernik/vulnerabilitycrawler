   sound: Prevent buffer overflow in OSS load_mixer_volumes
   
   The load_mixer_volumes() function, which can be triggered by
   unprivileged users via the SOUND_MIXER_SETLEVELS ioctl, is vulnerable to
   a buffer overflow.  Because the provided "name" argument isn't
   guaranteed to be NULL terminated at the expected 32 bytes, it's possible
   to overflow past the end of the last element in the mixer_vols array.
   Further exploitation can result in an arbitrary kernel write (via
   subsequent calls to load_mixer_volumes()) leading to privilege
   escalation, or arbitrary kernel reads via get_mixer_levels().  In
   addition, the strcmp() may leak bytes beyond the mixer_vols array.
