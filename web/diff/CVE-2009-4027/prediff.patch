   mac80211: fix spurious delBA handling
   
   Lennert Buytenhek noticed that delBA handling in mac80211
   was broken and has remotely triggerable problems, some of
   which are due to some code shuffling I did that ended up
   changing the order in which things were done -- this was

         mac80211: A-MPDU Tx add delBA from recipient support
   
   The first problem is that I moved a BUG_ON before various
   checks -- thereby making it possible to hit. As the comment
   indicates, the BUG_ON can be removed since the ampdu_action
   callback must already exist when the state is != IDLE.
   
   The second problem isn't easily exploitable but there's a
   race condition due to unconditionally setting the state to
   OPERATIONAL when a delBA frame is received, even when no
   aggregation session was ever initiated. All the drivers
   accept stopping the session even then, but that opens a
   race window where crashes could happen before the driver
   accepts it. Right now, a WARN_ON may happen with non-HT
   drivers, while the race opens only for HT drivers.
   
   For this case, there are two things necessary to fix it:
    1) don't process spurious delBA frames, and be more careful
       about the session state; don't drop the lock
   
    2) HT drivers need to be prepared to handle a session stop
       even before the session was really started -- this is
       true for all drivers (that support aggregation) but
       iwlwifi which can be fixed easily. The other HT drivers
       (ath9k and ar9170) are behaving properly already.
