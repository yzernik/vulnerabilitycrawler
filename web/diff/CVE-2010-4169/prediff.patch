   perf_events: Fix perf_counter_mmap() hook in mprotect()
   
   As pointed out by Linus, commit dab5855 ("perf_counter: Add mmap event hooks to
   mprotect()") is fundamentally wrong as mprotect_fixup() can free 'vma' due to
   merging. Fix the problem by moving perf_event_mmap() hook to
   mprotect_fixup().
   
   Note: there's another successful return path from mprotect_fixup() if old
   flags equal to new flags. We don't, however, need to call
   perf_event_mmap() there because 'perf' already knows the VMA is
   executable.
