   GFS2: make sure fallocate bytes is a multiple of blksize
   
   The GFS2 fallocate code chooses a target size to for allocating chunks of
   space.  Whenever it can't find any resource groups with enough space free, it
   halves its target. Since this target is in bytes, eventually it will no longer
   be a multiple of blksize.  As long as there is more space available in the
   resource group than the target, this isn't a problem, since gfs2 will use the
   actual space available, which is always a multiple of blksize.  However,
   when gfs couldn't fallocate a bigger chunk than the target, it was using the
   non-blksize aligned number. This caused a BUG in later code that required
   blksize aligned offsets.  GFS2 now ensures that bytes is always a multiple of
   blksize
