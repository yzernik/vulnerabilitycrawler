   usb: iowarrior: don't trust report_size for buffer size
   
   If the iowarrior devices in this case statement support more than 8 bytes
   per report, it is possible to write past the end of a kernel heap allocation.
   This will probably never be possible, but change the allocation to be more
   defensive anyway.
