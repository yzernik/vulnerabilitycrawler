   cifs: Fix a kernel BUG with remote OS/2 server (try #3)
   
   While chasing a bug report involving a OS/2 server, I noticed the server sets
   pSMBr->CountHigh to a incorrect value even in case of normal writes. This
   results in 'nbytes' being computed wrongly and triggers a kernel BUG at
   mm/filemap.c.
   
   void iov_iter_advance(struct iov_iter *i, size_t bytes)
   {
           BUG_ON(i->count < bytes);    <--- BUG here
   
   Why the server is setting 'CountHigh' is not clear but only does so after
   writing 64k bytes. Though this looks like the server bug, the client side
   crash may not be acceptable.
   
   The workaround is to mask off high 16 bits if the number of bytes written as
   returned by the server is greater than the bytes requested by the client as
   suggested by Jeff Layton.
