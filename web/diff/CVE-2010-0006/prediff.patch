   ipv6: skb_dst() can be NULL in ipv6_hop_jumbo().
   
   This fixes CERT-FI FICORA #341748
   
   Discovered by Olli Jarva and Tuomo Untinen from the CROSS
   project at Codenomicon Ltd.
   
   Just like in CVE-2007-4567, we can't rely upon skb_dst() being
   non-NULL at this point.  We fixed that in commit
   e76b2b2567b83448c2ee85a896433b96150c92e6 ("[IPV6]: Do no rely on
   skb->dst before it is assigned.")
   
   However commit 483a47d2fe794328d29950fe00ce26dd405d9437 ("ipv6: added
   net argument to IP6_INC_STATS_BH") put a new version of the same bug
   into this function.
   
   Complicating analysis further, this bug can only trigger when network
   namespaces are enabled in the build.  When namespaces are turned off,
   the dev_net() does not evaluate it's argument, so the dereference
   would not occur.
   
   So, for a long time, namespaces couldn't be turned on unless SYSFS was
   disabled.  Therefore, this code has largely been disabled except by
   people turning it on explicitly for namespace development.
