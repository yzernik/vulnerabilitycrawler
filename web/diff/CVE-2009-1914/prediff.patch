   sparc64: Fix crash with /proc/iomem
   
   When you compile kernel on Sparc64 with heap memory checking and type
   "cat /proc/iomem", you get a crash, because pointers in struct
   resource are uninitialized.
   
   Most code fills struct resource with zeros, so I assume that it is
   responsibility of the caller of request_resource to initialized it,
   not the responsibility of request_resource functuion.
   
   After 2.6.29 is out, there could be a check for uninitialized fields
   added to request_resource to avoid crashes like this.
