   NFSv4: Fix a problem whereby a buggy server can oops the kernel
   
   We just had a case in which a buggy server occasionally returns the wrong
   attributes during an OPEN call. While the client does catch this sort of
   condition in nfs4_open_done(), and causes the nfs4_atomic_open() to return
   -EISDIR, the logic in nfs_atomic_lookup() is broken, since it causes a
   fallback to an ordinary lookup instead of just returning the error.
   
   When the buggy server then returns a regular file for the fallback lookup,
   the VFS allows the open, and bad things start to happen, since the open
   file doesn't have any associated NFSv4 state.
   
   The fix is firstly to return the EISDIR/ENOTDIR errors immediately, and
   secondly to ensure that we are always careful when dereferencing the
   nfs_open_context state pointer.
