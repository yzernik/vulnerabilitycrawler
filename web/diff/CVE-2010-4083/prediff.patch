   sys_semctl: fix kernel stack leakage
   
   The semctl syscall has several code paths that lead to the leakage of
   uninitialized kernel stack memory (namely the IPC_INFO, SEM_INFO,
   IPC_STAT, and SEM_STAT commands) during the use of the older, obsolete
   version of the semid_ds struct.
   
   The copy_semid_to_user() function declares a semid_ds struct on the stack
   and copies it back to the user without initializing or zeroing the
   "sem_base", "sem_pending", "sem_pending_last", and "undo" pointers,
   allowing the leakage of 16 bytes of kernel stack memory.
   
   The code is still reachable on 32-bit systems - when calling semctl()
   newer glibc's automatically OR the IPC command with the IPC_64 flag, but
   invoking the syscall directly allows users to use the older versions of
   the struct.
