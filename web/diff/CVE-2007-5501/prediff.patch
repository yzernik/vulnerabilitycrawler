   [TCP]: Make sure write_queue_from does not begin with NULL ptr
   
   NULL ptr can be returned from tcp_write_queue_head to cached_skb
   and then assigned to skb if packets_out was zero. Without this,
   system is vulnerable to a carefully crafted ACKs which obviously
   is remotely triggerable.
   
   Besides, there's very little that needs to be done in sacktag
   if there weren't any packets outstanding, just skipping the rest
   doesn't hurt.
