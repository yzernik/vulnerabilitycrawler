   dvb-core: Fix DoS bug in ULE decapsulation code that can be triggered by an invalid Payload Pointer
   
   ULE (Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation RFC 4326) decapsulation
   has a bug that causes endless loop when Payload Pointer of MPEG2-TS
   frame is 182 or 183.  Anyone who sends malicious MPEG2-TS frame will
   cause the receiver of ULE SNDU to go into endless loop.
   
   This patch was generated and tested against linux-2.6.32.9 and should
   apply cleanly to linux-2.6.33 as well because there was only one typo
   fix to dvb_net.c since v2.6.32.
   
   This bug was brought to you by modern day Santa Claus who decided to
   shower the satellite dish at Keio University with heavy snow causing
   huge burst of errors.  We, receiver end, received Santa Claus's gift in
   the form of kernel bug.
   
   Care has been taken not to introduce more bug by fixing this bug, but
   please scrutinize the code for I always produces buggy code.
