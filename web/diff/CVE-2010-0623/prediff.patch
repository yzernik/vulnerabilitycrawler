   futex_lock_pi() key refcnt fix
   
   This fixes a futex key reference count bug in futex_lock_pi(),
   where a key's reference count is incremented twice but decremented
   only once, causing the backing object to not be released.
   
   If the futex is created in a temporary file in an ext3 file system,
   this bug causes the file's inode to become an "undead" orphan,
   which causes an oops from a BUG_ON() in ext3_put_super() when the
   file system is unmounted. glibc's test suite is known to trigger this,
   see <http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14256>.
   
   The bug is a regression from 2.6.28-git3, namely Peter Zijlstra's
   38d47c1b7075bd7ec3881141bb3629da58f88dab "[PATCH] futex: rely on
   get_user_pages() for shared futexes". That commit made get_futex_key()
   also increment the reference count of the futex key, and updated its
   callers to decrement the key's reference count before returning.
   Unfortunately the normal exit path in futex_lock_pi() wasn't corrected:
   the reference count is incremented by get_futex_key() and queue_lock(),
   but the normal exit path only decrements once, via unqueue_me_pi().
   The fix is to put_futex_key() after unqueue_me_pi(), since 2.6.31
   this is easily done by 'goto out_put_key' rather than 'goto out'.
