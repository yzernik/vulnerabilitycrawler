   KVM: x86: Disallow hypercalls for guest callers in rings > 0
   
   So far unprivileged guest callers running in ring 3 can issue, e.g., MMU
   hypercalls. Normally, such callers cannot provide any hand-crafted MMU
   command structure as it has to be passed by its physical address, but
   they can still crash the guest kernel by passing random addresses.
   
   To close the hole, this patch considers hypercalls valid only if issued
   from guest ring 0. This may still be relaxed on a per-hypercall base in
   the future once required.
