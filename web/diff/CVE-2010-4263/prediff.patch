   igb: only use vlan_gro_receive if vlans are registered
   
   This change makes it so that vlan_gro_receive is only used if vlans have been
   registered to the adapter structure.  Previously we were just sending all vlan
   tagged frames in via this function but this results in a null pointer
   dereference when vlans are not registered.
