   mm_for_maps: take ->cred_guard_mutex to fix the race with exec
   
   The problem is minor, but without ->cred_guard_mutex held we can race
   with exec() and get the new ->mm but check old creds.
   
   Now we do not need to re-check task->mm after ptrace_may_access(), it
   can't be changed to the new mm under us.
   
   Strictly speaking, this also fixes another very minor problem. Unless
   security check fails or the task exits mm_for_maps() should never
   return NULL, the caller should get either old or new ->mm.
