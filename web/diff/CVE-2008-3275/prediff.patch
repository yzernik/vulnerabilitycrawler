   [patch] vfs: fix lookup on deleted directory
   
   Lookup can install a child dentry for a deleted directory.  This keeps
   the directory dentry alive, and the inode pinned in the cache and on
   disk, even after all external references have gone away.
   
   This isn't a big problem normally, since memory pressure or umount
   will clear out the directory dentry and its children, releasing the
   inode.  But for UBIFS this causes problems because its orphan area can
   overflow.
   
   Fix this by returning ENOENT for all lookups on a S_DEAD directory
   before creating a child dentry.
   
   Thanks to Zoltan Sogor for noticing this while testing UBIFS, and
   Artem for the excellent analysis of the problem and testing.
