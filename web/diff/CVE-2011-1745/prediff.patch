   agp: fix arbitrary kernel memory writes
   
   pg_start is copied from userspace on AGPIOC_BIND and AGPIOC_UNBIND ioctl
   cmds of agp_ioctl() and passed to agpioc_bind_wrap().  As said in the
   comment, (pg_start + mem->page_count) may wrap in case of AGPIOC_BIND,
   and it is not checked at all in case of AGPIOC_UNBIND.  As a result, user
   with sufficient privileges (usually "video" group) may generate either
   local DoS or privilege escalation.
