   Fix pktcdvd ioctl dev_minor range check
   
   The PKT_CTRL_CMD_STATUS device ioctl retrieves a pointer to a
   pktcdvd_device from the global pkt_devs array.  The index into this
   array is provided directly by the user and is a signed integer, so the
   comparison to ensure that it falls within the bounds of this array will
   fail when provided with a negative index.
   
   This can be used to read arbitrary kernel memory or cause a crash due to
   an invalid pointer dereference.  This can be exploited by users with
   permission to open /dev/pktcdvd/control (on many distributions, this is
   readable by group "cdrom").
